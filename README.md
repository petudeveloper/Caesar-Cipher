# Caesar Cipher

![screenshot](./readme_lib/Caesar_cipher.png)

This is a version of Caesar Cipher, powered by ruby and displayed in Terminal.
The concept is simple, it is a type of substitution cipher in which each character is replaced by a another character some fixed number of positions down the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).

## Tic-Tac-Toe for Dummies

This is a handbook of this cipher and usage, so that you don't get lost.

First of all, you need to tell the program if you want to cipher or decipher your text. For that, you will need to type ```code``` if you want to cipher or ```decode``` if you want to decipher your text.

After you will be asked to type the text you want to code or decode.

Later you will need to type a number that will help you code/decode your text.

Then console will return your text coded or decoded.

Finally, you will have to type again if you want to cipher or decipher again.

Easy, right?

You can stop running the program at any point with the ```Ctrl C``` key combination. You might need to also give a value and press enter at some points of the code before exiting. This is a fashionable way of rage-quitting.

Good luck and have fun sending secret messages!
